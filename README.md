Batiscaph is a research device that submerges into ocean and explores unknown space.
That's what this tool does -- submerges into Erlang node and observes how programs work in it.

In order to setup development environment and be able to run tests
you need to clone publically available probe repositiory into `probe` dir in the root of the repo.
